# LEMI-025

## Client
If we want to write a golang client for the LEMI025 instrument, we should be able to get the functionality in a library style from github.com/sss-eda/lemi025.

What do we need to be defined at this level?
  - functions
    * ReadConfig
    * ReadTime
    * SetTime
  - types
    * config
    * time
